## My process
 - I started with the barebones of the site before adding the styling. Once The mobile view of the website was done, I then started finishing the desktop layout, after that was the
 implementation of basic routing followed by the implementation of mobile nav.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide/)
